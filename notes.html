PREREQUISITES
    1)js

PROCESS OF REQUEST
    Browser sends a request through the network to an address to where it needs information from(URL).
    URL is located(hosted) in a server(another computer) connected to the internet.
    URL is converted to an address via DNS.
    Ip address is the id of every device on a network. 

FULL STACK 
    Result of the combination of pieces necessary for the full internet experience. 

    Front End
        Website loaded from the back end and requested by the front end, the actual code files that have the site and build it up by the browser.
        Summarized in:
            1)user
            2)client(browser)
                Medium to interact with the internet
    
    Back End 
        Logic on the server side concentrated on listening to requests from the client side and readies the responses to send back with data or resources. 

---CHATPER 2---
Package JSON
    Glorified json object that tells us what our project is about and contains all specs about the project.

EXPRESS
    Node package specifically designed to make fast uncomplicated servers.

SCRIPT
    Set of instructions to get server up and running

NODEMON
    NPM dev dependency that is looking for changes in the server file and restarts the server every time there is a change. 

REST EXTENSION
    Extension that lets you emulate sending http requests very easy without the need of a third party app.

MIDDLEWARE
    Config slammed in between request and response.

---CHAPTER 3---
Objective:
    1)Serve public files
    2)Path and URL modules

WHAT IS?    
    To do app with auth protection.

SQLite
    Lightweight, self-contained, serverless db engine widely used for applications needing a simple, efficient and reliable way to store and manage data. 

    WHAT
        Database engine
            RDBMS that follows SQL for managing data.
        Serverless
            unlike MySQL or PostgreSQL does not require a separate server. Operates directly on a database file.
        File Based
            All data, including tables, indexes, schemas are stored in a single .sqlite or .db file.
        Lightweight
            Size < 1mb
            Requires minimal setup
        Cross-Platform
            Works on virtually any platform, desktop to mobile.
    WHY
        Ease   
            No config or install needed, just include the SQLite library and start working.
            Ideal for beginners
        Embedded
            Can be directly embedded into an application
        Fast 
            Optimized for performance
            ACID compliant
        Free & Open Source
            Source code is in the public domain
        Use Cases
            Small-scale projects or prototyping before moving to larger database

    HOW
        Database File
            Operates on a single file. "my_database.sqlite" contains all your data.
        SQL Syntax
            Uses standard SQL to interact with database.
        Programming Interface 
            accessed via:
                CLI
                Integrated into programming language
                
NVM
    Tool used to manage multiple versions of node in a single system. 

    WHY
        Multiple Projects
            Different projects may require different versions of node.
        Testing
            Test compatibility with different versions of node.
        Stability
            Ensure stability by using a specific version of node.   

    COMMANDS
        nvm install <version>
            Installs a specific version of node.
        nvm use <version>
            Switches to a specific version of node.
        nvm ls
            Lists all installed versions of node.
        nvm uninstall <version>
            Uninstalls a specific version of node.
.env
    Simple file that stores environment variables in key - value format. Typically used to store sensitive information like API keys, passwords, etc.   

    STRUCTURE
        db settings
        api keys 

PROJECT STRUCTURE
    src
        server
        routes
        controller
        db
    public
        html and static files
    .env
    .gitignore
    .rest
    package.json

ENDPOINTS
    serve a website 
    auth
    CRUD 

BCRYPTJS
    Library that helps you hash passwords.

    HOW IT HELPS
        Does all the heavy math encryption for you.

JSONWEBTOKEN
    Library that helps you create and verify tokens.

    HOW IT HELPS
        Creates a token that can be used to authenticate a user.

FLAGS
    --watch(nodemon)
        Watches for changes in the file and restarts the server.
    --experimental-sqlite
        Allows you to use sqlite in a more experimental way.
    --experimental-strip-types
        Removes types from the database.
    --env-file=.env(dotenv)
        Allows you to use the .env file in the project.
PUBLIC
    Folder that contains all the static files for the project.

    IN THE PROGRAM STRUCTURE
        Contains all the html, css, js files.

    IN THE HTTP REQUEST
        Contains all the files that are sent to the client.

PATH MODULE 
    The path module provides utilities to work with file paths, such as combining directories and filenames into a valid path, regardless of the operating system.

URL MODULE 
    The url module is used to work with URLs. In this code, the function fileURLToPath converts a file:// URL (like import.meta.url) into a filesystem path.

What are __filename and __dirname?
    __filename: Represents the absolute path to the current file.
    __dirname: Represents the absolute path to the directory containing the current file.

Why Absolute Paths in Servers?:
    Servers need to know exactly where files are located on the disk to serve them.
    Relative paths can cause issues depending on where the server is run from

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../public')));
    Tells Express to serve all files in the public directory as static assets.
    Example: 
        If a user requests /styles.css, Express will look for styles.css in the public folder.
        This generates an absolute path to the public directory.
path.join	
	Combines multiple path segments into one valid path.
__dirname	
    Absolute path to the directory of the current file.
fileURLToPath	
    Converts a file URL (from import.meta.url) to a filesystem path.
Static Middleware	
    Serves static files (CSS, images, etc.) from a specified folder.
Absolute Path	
    A full path from the root directory.
Relative Path	
    A path relative to the current location in the filesystem or codebase.
res.sendFile	
    Sends an HTML file (or any file) to the client.

What Happens When the Server Runs?
    A user accesses your app in the browser (e.g., http://localhost:5000/).
The server:
    Matches the / route and serves index.html from the public folder.   
If the HTML references files (e.g., CSS, JS):
    The browser requests these files (e.g., GET /styles.css).
    The static middleware serves these files from the public folder.

AUTH ENDPOINT 
    An endpoint that requires a user to be authenticated to access it.

    WHY
        Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
        Ensures that only authenticated users can access certain routes.
        Allows users to log in and access their data.

    HOW
        Use middleware to check if a user is authenticated.
        If the user is authenticated, allow access to the route.
        If the user is not authenticated, return an error message.

    ROUTER OBJECT
        A router object is an instance of the Express Router class.
        It allows you to create modular, mountable route handlers.
        You can use router objects to define routes in separate files and then use them in your main app.

    MIDDLEWARE
        Middleware is a function that has access to the request and response objects.
        It can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function.
        Middleware can be used to perform tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

    PROCESS
        1) We are using the bcryptjs package to hash the password before storing it in the database.
        2) We are using the jsonwebtoken package to generate a token when the user logs in.
        3) We are using the db object to interact with the database.
        4) We are using the express.Router() method to create a new router object.
